This is a browser extension to store files downloaded from emails for later investigations againt phishing campaigns. It stores then in a folder called EmailAttachments. The owner of the computer will have to configure their logging or backup systems to further copy files from the EmailAttachments folder to a more secure location for later investigation, such as on a separate server.

Phishing accounts for 36% of data breaches. About half of the data breaches happen through email, and about 20-30% of the email phishing attacks happen through file downloads (other phishing emails typically contain malicious urls). Thus, about 2% of these attacks happen through email malicioius file downloads. 

Though this number may be small, the same sort of code can be developed for other sources. Furthermore, we are considering storing a list of url's clicked on from emails for a future project. Furthermore, if we can use the malicioius email files to fine-tune our defensive systems, we then protect our systems against the same file regardless of its source.

Originally we had considered that all internet files downloaded should be stored for forensic purposes. However, this is not typically done as that would take up too much storage (imagine downloading a 10 gb program and it gets stored for forensics). However, if we only do so for email attachments this is less severe.
